## Code Quality

- âœ… No linter errors in any modified files
- âœ… Type hints maintained throughout
- âœ… Docstrings added to new functions
- âœ… Error handling implemented
- âœ… Backward compatibility preserved

## Safety Features Implemented

1. âœ… **Mode Indicators**: Clear visual distinction between paper and real
2. âœ… **Double Confirmation**: "confirm" required for real trades
3. âœ… **Balance Checks**: Pre-trade USDC validation
4. âœ… **Trade Validation**: Size, token, market checks
5. âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with clear messages
6. âœ… **Private Key Security**: Only in .env, never logged

## Testing Requirements

The following should be tested before production use:

### Paper Mode Tests
- [ ] Paper trading still works without regression
- [ ] Trades recorded correctly as "paper" mode
- [ ] Research flow works in paper mode
- [ ] Portfolio displays correctly

### Real Mode Tests
- [ ] Real mode initializes with valid POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY
- [ ] Warning shown when POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY missing
- [ ] `/trade` command executes real orders
- [ ] Double confirmation required
- [ ] Trades recorded with "real" mode and order_id
- [ ] Portfolio shows on-chain balances
- [ ] Failed trades handled gracefully

### Configuration Tests
- [ ] New installations create correct config
- [ ] Existing configs migrate properly
- [ ] Mode switching works (paper â†” real)

### Database Tests
- [ ] New columns added automatically
- [ ] Existing trades still readable
- [ ] New trades include mode and order_id

## Known Limitations

1. **Position Closing**: `/close` requires enhancement to store token_id with trades
2. **Order Monitoring**: No real-time status updates
3. **Partial Fills**: Not handled explicitly
4. **Slippage**: Fixed at 2%, not configurable

## Next Steps

For production readiness:

1. Test with testnet/small amounts first
2. Verify USDC balance and approvals on Polygon
3. Test all command flows in real mode
4. Monitor first trades closely
5. Consider adding transaction history export
6. Implement position closing enhancement
