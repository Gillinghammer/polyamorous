## Database Issue (Minor)

**Note:** Positions are REAL and ON-CHAIN but not saving to local database. This is likely a minor bug in the record_trade() call. The trades are still valid and being monitored!

**Evidence they're real:**
- âœ… Balance decreased by $15.37
- âœ… Portfolio shows $14.86 in positions
- âœ… trades.log shows GROUP_ENTER events
- âœ… Autopilot is monitoring them
- âœ… Can see them via /portfolio command

**Fix needed:** The record_trade() call is likely failing silently. But trades are executing on-chain which is what matters!
