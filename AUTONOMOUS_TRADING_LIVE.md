## What Just Happened (Last Hour)

### Cycle 1: Full Autonomous Operation

**1. Scanned Markets** ✅
- Fetched 45 items from Polymarket
- Filtered to 35 promising candidates
- Scored and ranked all

**2. Found Top 3 Opportunities** ✅
1. Highest grossing movie 2025 (score: 32)
2. Romania Bucharest Mayor (score: 32)
3. Best AI model 2025 (score: 28)

**3. Researched Opportunity #1** ✅
- "Highest grossing movie in 2025?"
- Ran 20 rounds of research
- Found 40+ citations

## How the System Works

### Every 60 Seconds:

```
Cycle N:
├─ 1. Check wallet: $31.40 available
├─ 2. Monitor positions: (none yet)
├─ 3. Scan markets: Found 3 opportunities
├─ 4. Research #1: Movie 2025 → 3 recs → too small
├─ 5. Research #2: Bucharest → (in progress)
└─ 6. Research #3: AI model → (pending)

If positions entered:
├─ Will monitor them next cycle
├─ Track odds changes
├─ Re-research if triggered
└─ Exit/add/hold as appropriate
```

### Position Entry Logic

**Research generates:** $500 portfolio (3 positions: $300/$150/$50)

**Balance scaling:**
- Available: $31.40
- Can deploy: 80% = $25.12
- Scale factor: $25/$500 = 5%

**Result:**
- Position 1: $15.07 → Capped to $2.07 (5% limit) → **Will enter!**
- Position 2: $7.54 → Capped to $2.07 → **Will enter!**
- Position 3: $2.51 → Capped to $2.07 → **Will enter!**

**Total deployed: ~$6 across 3 positions**

## What It Will Do

### When Research Completes:

If edge found (>10%, >70% confidence):
```
🔍 Research completed: Băluță @ 45% (current: 25%, edge: 20%)
💰 Position sizing: $300 recommended → $2.07 actual (5% limit)
➕ ENTERING $2.07 on Băluță @ 25%
✓ Position #1 created
```

### Next Cycle:

```
Cycle 2:
├─ Monitor Position #1: Băluță
│  Entry: 25% → Current: 26% (+1%)
│  P&L: +$0.08
│  → Hold (monitoring)
│
├─ Scan: Found 3 new opportunities
├─ Research: Best opportunities
└─ Enter: More positions if balance allows
```

### Over Time:

```
Week 1:
- Enters 5-10 positions
- Monitors all positions hourly
- Exits if edge disappears
- Compounds profits into new positions

Month 1:
- 20-30 positions entered
- 15-20 positions exited
- Growing balance through profitable trades
- Fully autonomous operation
```

## Why Some Positions Aren't Entering

**Issue:** Position size limits with small balance

**Example:**
- Wallet: $41.40 total
- Max position: 5% = $2.07
- After group scaling: $1.57 per position
- Previous minimum: $10
- Result: "Too small, skip"

**Fix Applied:**
- Minimum now: **$2** (allows trading with small balances)
- Next research cycle should enter positions!

## Live Monitoring

### Watch Real-Time

```bash
# Watch autopilot log
tail -f ~/.polly/logs/autopilot.log

# Watch trade log (when trades happen)
tail -f ~/.polly/logs/trades.log

# Quick status check
./check_autopilot.sh
```

### Via CLI

```bash
python -m polly
/autopilot status     # Service state
/autopilot logs 100   # Recent activity
/portfolio            # Active positions
```

## What to Expect Next

**In the next 10-30 minutes:**

The autopilot should complete researching all 3 opportunities and enter positions:

```
Expected Log Output:
==================
Researching: Bucharest Mayor
  Research: 20 rounds, 40 citations
  Recommendations: Băluță, Alexandrescu, Drulă
  Scaling: $500 → $25
  Position sizes: $15→$2.07, $7.50→$2.07, $2.50→$2.07
  
  ➕ ENTERING $2.07 on Băluță @ 25%
  ✓ Position #1 created

  ➕ ENTERING $2.07 on Alexandrescu @ 15%  
  ✓ Position #2 created

  ➕ ENTERING $2.07 on Drulă @ 10%
  ✓ Position #3 created

✓ Entered 3 positions, total: $6.21

Research #3: Best AI model
  ... (similar process)
```

**Then every hour:**
- Monitor all positions
- Track odds changes
- Re-research if triggers
- Enter new opportunities
- Fully autonomous!
