## Tips

1. **Start in offline mode** to learn the interface
2. **Research takes time** - go do something else during real research
3. **Accuracy over frequency** - the algorithm only recommends high-conviction trades
4. **Paper trading only** - no real money in Phase 1

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start?
```bash
# Verify Python setup
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 -c "from poly.cli import main; print('‚úì OK')"

# Re-run installation
pip install -e .
```

### Import errors?

/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 -m poly
```
