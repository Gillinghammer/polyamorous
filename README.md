# Polly - Polymarket Research & Trading CLI

A command-line application for researching Polymarket prediction markets and executing informed trading strategies using deep AI-powered research.

## Overview

Polly helps you find edge in prediction markets through:
- **Deep Research**: Multi-round AI research using Grok 4 to find information asymmetries
- **Smart Trading**: Paper and real trading with position evaluation algorithms
- **Multi-Outcome Support**: Handle both binary markets and grouped multi-outcome events
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor positions, P&L, and strategy performance
