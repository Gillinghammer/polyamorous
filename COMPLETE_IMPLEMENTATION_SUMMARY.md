## From Your Original Question to Complete Solution

### Your Questions
1. "Are we using the Gamma API?"
2. "Why only yes/no polls?"
3. "Why only small number?"
4. "Can we get trade recommendations with varying position sizes to form hedges?"

### What You Got âœ…

1. **Yes, Gamma API `/events` endpoint** - Recommended approach
2. **46 multi-outcome grouped events** - 2-128 candidates each
3. **3,100+ markets** across 500+ events
4. **Complete portfolio optimization** - Varying stakes, multi-position hedges
