# PRD: Polly - Command-Based Polymarket Research & Paper Trading

## 1) Summary

A Python command-based application that helps users research Polymarket polls and make informed predictions. The app fetches polls filtered by time-to-expiry, runs deep agentic research using Grok 4 (Web + X search) to find asymmetric information, evaluates if the odds justify taking a position, and tracks paper trading performance. Users bring their own xAI (Grok) API key.

**üìÅ Documentation**: See `docs/` folder for implementation guides:
- `grok-agentic-guide.md` - Agentic research implementation  
- `polymarket-client-guide.md` - Market data fetching

## 2) Goals & Non‚ÄëGoals

**Phase 1 Goals**

* Fetch polls filtered by time-to-expiry (7, 14, 30, 180 days)
* Enable deep, multi-round agentic research to find asymmetric information
* Show research progress (research can take 20-40 minutes)
* Evaluate if current odds justify taking a position (accuracy over frequency)
* Track paper trades with win rate, profit metrics, and projected APR
* Hold positions until poll expiry (no early exits in Phase 1)
* Filter research results by status (completed, pending, archived)

**Non‚ÄëGoals (Phase 1)**

* Real money execution/custody - paper trading only
* Early position exits - hold until expiry
* Complex portfolio optimization
* Multi‚Äëexchange support
* Mobile or web interface

## 3) Users & Use Cases

**Primary user**: Individual prediction market trader seeking asymmetric information advantages

**Top use cases**

## 7) Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Poll Ingestion & Filtering

> **See**: `docs/polymarket-client-guide.md` for complete implementation examples

* Fetch active Polymarket prediction market polls with fields: `id, question, options[], current_odds{}, resolves_at, open_interest, volume_24h, category`
* **Filter by time-to-expiry**: 
  - `/polls` - All active polls
  - `/polls 7` - Polls ending in 7 days
  - `/polls 14` - Polls ending in 14 days
  - `/polls 30` - Polls ending in 30 days
  - `/polls 180` - Polls ending in 180 days
* **Display**: List showing:
  - Poll ID (for research command)
  - Poll question (prediction market)
  - Options with current odds
  - Time remaining until resolution

### 7.2 Deep Agentic Research (Grok 4)

> **See**: `docs/grok-agentic-guide.md` for streaming implementation and multi-round patterns

**Goal**: Find asymmetric information to accurately forecast poll outcome

**Tools**: Grok 4 with Web Search and X Search capabilities

**Process**:
1. Initial research round analyzes poll question and identifies key information gaps
2. Multiple iterative rounds (no hard limit) to gather information:
   - Web search for news, analysis, data
   - X search for real-time sentiment, insider knowledge
   - Each round builds on previous findings
3. Continue until confident in understanding all intricacies OR diminishing returns
4. Expected duration: 20-40 minutes per poll

**Output**:
- Prediction: Which option is most likely (with probability)
- Confidence: 0-100% confidence in the prediction
- Rationale: Key findings explaining the prediction
- Citations: Sources used (web links, X posts)
- Information asymmetries: What the market might be missing

**UX Requirements**:
- MUST show live progress during research (critical for long duration)
- Display current research round/activity
- Show interim findings as they develop
- Allow user to monitor without blocking command interface

**Implementation**: Use Grok's streaming API with real-time tool call monitoring (see guide)

### 7.3 Position Evaluation Algorithm

**Philosophy**: Accuracy over frequency. Only enter when edge is clear.

**Inputs**:
- Research prediction: probability for each option
- Research confidence: 0-100%
- Current market odds for each option
- Time to expiry

**Algorithm**:
1. Calculate expected value for each option:
   ```
   EV = (predicted_prob * payout) - (1 - predicted_prob) * stake
   ```
2. Calculate edge vs. market:
   ```
   edge = predicted_prob - implied_prob_from_odds
   ```
3. Adjust for confidence:
   ```
   adjusted_edge = edge * (confidence / 100)
   ```
4. Decision criteria (all must be true):
   - `adjusted_edge > minimum_threshold` (e.g., 10%)
   - `confidence > minimum_confidence` (e.g., 70%)
   - `EV > 0` (positive expected value)

**Recommendation**:
- ENTER: Option to bet on + suggested stake
- PASS: Why the position isn't justified (weak edge, low confidence, etc.)

### 7.4 Paper Trading & Research History

**Phase 1 Constraints**:
- Paper trading only (no real money)
- Fixed stake amount per trade (e.g., $100)
- Hold until poll expiry (no early exits)
- Track all positions to conclusion

**Trade Record**:
```
{
  poll_id, 
  question,
  selected_option,
  entry_odds,
  stake_amount,
  entry_timestamp,
  predicted_probability,
  confidence,
  research_summary,
  status: "active" | "won" | "lost",
  resolves_at,
  actual_outcome: null | option_name,
  profit_loss: null | number
}
```

**User Decision Flow**:
1. After research completes, display recommendation
2. Show: "Recommendation: BET on [Option X] at current odds of [Y]" or "PASS - [reason]"
3. If ENTER recommended, prompt: "Enter trade with $100 stake? (y/n)"
4. If user confirms (y): Record paper trade, add to active positions
5. Position held until poll resolves

**Research History Display**:
- Filter options:
  * `completed` - Research finished, recommendation available
  * `pending` - Research in progress or not yet started
  * `archived` - Poll has resolved
- For each research result, display:
  * Poll ID
  * Recommended bet (option name or "PASS")
  * Odds (if bet recommended)
  * Potential payout if invested $100 (calculated from odds)

### 7.5 Portfolio & Performance Metrics

**Key Metrics**:
1. **Active Positions**: Count of current open trades
2. **Win Rate**: Resolved wins / total resolved trades (e.g., "12/15 (80%)")
3. **Total Profit**: Sum of all P&L from resolved trades
4. **Average Profit**: Total profit / number of resolved trades
5. **Projected APR**: Annualized return based on average profit and holding period

**Calculations**:
- Win when actual outcome matches our position
- Loss when actual outcome differs
- Profit = (stake * odds) - stake [if win], or -stake [if loss]
- APR = (total_profit / total_staked) * (365 / avg_days_held) * 100

**Display** (via `/portfolio` command):
- Show metrics at top
- List active positions: poll question, our bet, odds, days left
- List recent resolved trades: outcome, profit/loss, duration

## 8) Non‚ÄëFunctional Requirements

* **Performance**: 
  - Polls list loads in < 3 seconds
  - Research runs 20-40 minutes (acceptable, must show progress)
  - Application remains responsive during long operations
  
* **Resilience**: 
  - Handle API errors gracefully with retries
  - Save research progress (don't lose 40min of work on crash)
  - Persist trades to disk (SQLite)
  
* **UX**:
  - Live progress indicators for long operations
  - Clear, readable output (no terminal clutter)
  - Intuitive command syntax with helpful error messages
  
* **Security**: 
  - Load xAI API key from environment variable
  - Never log API keys
  - Store data locally only
  
* **Data Persistence**:
  - SQLite database for trades, research, positions
  - Survive app restarts
  - Export capability (future: CSV/JSON)

## 12) Research Prompt Strategy

**Goal**: Find asymmetric information to forecast poll outcome accurately

**Prompt Template**:
```
You are a prediction market analyst researching this poll:

Question: {poll_question}
Options: {options}
Current market odds: {current_odds}
Resolves: {resolution_date}

Your goal is to find information asymmetries that could give us edge over the market.

Phase 1: Identify Information Gaps
- What key factors determine this outcome?
- What information is the market potentially missing?
- What sources would have the best insights?

Phase 2: Deep Research (use Web Search and X Search)
- Search for recent news, analysis, data
- Look for expert opinions, insider knowledge
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Identify sentiment vs. facts

Phase 3: Synthesize
- Which option is most likely? (probability 0-1)
- How confident are you? (0-100%)
- What are the key reasons? (bullet points)
- What information asymmetries did you find?
- List all sources used

Continue researching until you have high confidence OR hit diminishing returns.

## 15) Multi-Outcome Market Support - Implementation Plan

### Discovery Summary

**Finding**: Polymarket's multi-outcome markets are actually **groups of binary markets within a single event**.

**Example**: "Democratic Presidential Nominee 2028" event contains 128 binary Yes/No markets (one per candidate):
- "Will Gretchen Whitmer win?" (Yes/No) - $210k liquidity
- "Will Oprah Winfrey win?" (Yes/No) - $322k liquidity  
- ... 126 more candidates

**Indicators**:
- `enableNegRisk: true` - Market uses neg-risk contracts for mutual exclusivity
- `showAllOutcomes: true` - Display all options together
- Event has multiple markets (e.g., 128 markets in one event)

**Current API Status**:
- Total events: 500+ active
- Events with grouped markets: 167 (33%)
- Largest grouped events: 128 markets each
- Total market coverage: 3,100+ binary markets

### Architecture Changes Required

#### Phase 1: Data Model Updates

**1.1 Add `MarketGroup` Model** (`polly/models.py`)
```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class MarketGroup:
    """Represents a multi-outcome event with grouped markets."""
    id: str                          # Event ID
    title: str                       # "Democratic Presidential Nominee 2028"
    description: str
    category: str
    tags: List[str]
    end_date: datetime
    liquidity: float                 # Total event liquidity
    volume_24h: float
    enable_neg_risk: bool            # True for multi-outcome
    show_all_outcomes: bool          # True for multi-outcome
    markets: List[Market]            # All candidate markets
    resolution_source: str
```

**1.2 Update `Market` Model** - Add event context:
```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class Market:
    # ... existing fields ...
    event_id: str | None = None      # Parent event if part of group
    event_title: str | None = None   # For context
    is_grouped: bool = False         # True if part of multi-outcome event
```

**1.3 Update `Trade` Model** - Support grouped positions:
```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class Trade:
    # ... existing fields ...
    event_id: str | None = None      # Parent event for grouped trades
    event_title: str | None = None
    is_grouped: bool = False         # Part of multi-outcome strategy
    group_strategy: str | None = None  # "hedge", "multiple_positions", etc.
```

**1.4 Update `ResearchResult` Model** - Support multi-market recommendations:
```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class ResearchResult:
    # ... existing fields ...
    event_id: str | None = None
    recommendations: List[MarketRecommendation]  # Can suggest multiple
    
@dataclass(slots=True)
class MarketRecommendation:
    """Single recommendation within research."""
    market_id: str
    market_question: str
    prediction: str                  # "Yes" or "No"
    probability: float              # 0-1
    confidence: float               # 0-100
    rationale: str
    entry_suggested: bool
```

#### Phase 2: API & Fetching Updates

**2.1 Update `PolymarketService._fetch_markets_sync()`** (`polly/services/polymarket.py`)

Current: Flattens all markets into list
Needed: Detect and preserve grouped events

```python
def _fetch_markets_sync(self, page: int | None = 1, page_size: int = 20):
    """Return both individual markets AND grouped events."""
    
    # For each event:
    #   - If event has 1 market: Return as individual Market
    #   - If event has >1 market AND enableNegRisk/showAllOutcomes:
    #     Return as MarketGroup
    
    # Apply filters to both types
    # Sort by liquidity score
    # Return Union[List[Market], List[MarketGroup]]
```

**2.2 Add Helper Methods**:
```python
def is_multi_outcome_event(event: dict) -> bool:
    """Check if event represents multi-outcome market."""
    return (
        event.get("enableNegRisk") or 
        event.get("showAllOutcomes")
    ) and len(event.get("markets", [])) > 1

def create_market_group(event: dict) -> MarketGroup:
    """Convert event with multiple markets into MarketGroup."""
    # Extract all markets
    # Enrich with event metadata
    # Return structured group
```

#### Phase 3: UI Updates

**3.1 Update `/polls` Display** (`polly/commands/polls.py`)

Current: Shows flat list of binary markets
Needed: Show both individual markets AND grouped events

Display Format:
```
‚îè‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î≥‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î≥‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î≥‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î≥‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î≥‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îì

```

**3.2 Update `create_polls_table()`** (`polly/ui/formatters.py`)
- Handle both Market and MarketGroup types
- Show group indicators
- Display top N candidates for grouped events
- Format group differently from binary

**3.3 Add Group Detail View**

New command: `/polls <group_id> detail` or auto-expand on selection
```
Event: Democratic Presidential Nominee 2028 (128 candidates)
Total Liquidity: $13.1M | Expires: May 2028

Top Candidates by Probability:
  1. Gretchen Whitmer    22%  ($210k liq)
  2. Gavin Newsom        18%  ($798k liq)
  3. Oprah Winfrey       12%  ($322k liq)
  ...
  Show all 128 candidates? (y/n)
```

#### Phase 4: Research Updates

**4.1 Update Research Prompt** (`polly/services/research.py`)

Add event context awareness:
```python
if market_or_group.is_grouped:
    prompt = f"""
    You are researching a MULTI-OUTCOME event:
    
    Event: {group.title}
    Total Options: {len(group.markets)}
    Current Market Leaders: {top_3_by_odds}
    Event Liquidity: ${group.liquidity}
    
    Your goal: Analyze ALL viable candidates and identify:
    1. Most likely winner(s)
    2. Overvalued candidates (market too optimistic)
    3. Undervalued candidates (market missing something)
    4. Hedge opportunities (multiple positions to reduce risk)
    
    You may recommend positions on MULTIPLE candidates if:
    - Hedging reduces variance while maintaining edge
    - Multiple undervalued candidates improve expected value
    - Correlation between candidates justifies combined strategy
    
    Output format:
    - Primary recommendation: Candidate + confidence + rationale
    - Secondary recommendations: Other positions + why
    - Hedge strategy: How positions work together (if applicable)
    - Citations: All sources
    """
```

**4.2 Multi-Market Evaluation**

Update evaluator to handle:
- Multiple position recommendations from single research
- Portfolio-level EV calculation across correlated positions
- Hedge strategies (e.g., bet on top 2 candidates to reduce risk)

```python
def evaluate_group_position(
    research: ResearchResult,
    group: MarketGroup
) -> List[PositionRecommendation]:
    """Evaluate positions across multiple markets in a group."""
    
    # For each recommended market in the group:
    #   - Calculate individual EV
    #   - Calculate correlation with other recommendations
    #   - Assess combined EV and risk
    
    # Return list of recommended positions with:
    #   - Individual rationale
    #   - How they work together as a strategy
    #   - Total expected value
    #   - Risk reduction from hedging (if applicable)
```

#### Phase 5: Trading & Portfolio Updates

**5.1 Update Trade Entry** (`polly/commands/trade.py`)

Support entering multiple positions from single research:
```python
# After research recommends multiple positions:
print("Research recommends 3 positions:")
print("  1. Gretchen Whitmer YES @ 22% - $100 stake")
print("  2. Gavin Newsom YES @ 18% - $100 stake")  
print("  3. Combined EV: +$X | Risk reduction: Y%")
print()
print("Enter all recommended positions? (y/n/custom)")
# If custom: Allow selecting subset of recommendations
```

**5.2 Update Portfolio Display** (`polly/commands/portfolio.py`)

Group related positions:
```
Active Positions (3 events, 5 total positions)

**5.3 Database Schema Updates** (`polly/storage/trades.py`)

Add tables for grouped positions:
```sql
-- New table
CREATE TABLE market_groups (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    end_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    liquidity REAL,
    volume_24h REAL,
    enable_neg_risk BOOLEAN,
    show_all_outcomes BOOLEAN,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Update trades table
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN event_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN event_title TEXT;
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN is_grouped BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN group_strategy TEXT;

-- New table for tracking grouped trade strategies
CREATE TABLE trade_groups (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    strategy_type TEXT,  -- "hedge", "multiple_positions", etc.
    total_stake REAL,
    combined_ev REAL,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES market_groups(id)
);
```

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Keep Binary Markets Simple**: Don't force everything into groups. Support both:
   - Individual binary markets (majority of markets)
   - Grouped multi-outcome events (33% of events)

**2. Research Can Recommend Multiple Positions**: 
   - Primary recommendation + optional secondary positions
   - Explain how positions work together
   - Calculate combined EV and risk

**3. Portfolio Tracks Groups**:
   - Show individual positions
   - Roll up to event-level strategy view
   - Calculate group-level P&L

**4. UI Mimics Polymarket Web**:
   - Grouped events displayed prominently
   - Expand to see all candidates
   - Clear visual hierarchy

**5. Autopilot-Ready Architecture**:
   - Event monitoring (not just market monitoring)
   - Strategy-level decisions (not just single trades)
   - Correlation and hedge awareness built-in

### Migration Path

**No backwards compatibility needed** - User approved fresh start:
1. Drop existing database
2. Implement new schema
3. Update all code to new models
4. Test with live data
5. Deploy

### Success Metrics

- [ ] Can fetch and display 167+ grouped events
- [ ] Can research multi-outcome events
- [ ] Can enter multiple positions from single research
- [ ] Portfolio correctly groups related positions
- [ ] UI closely matches Polymarket web experience
- [ ] Foundation in place for autopilot trading
