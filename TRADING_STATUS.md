# Polymarket Trading Status - Current State

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Fully Functional Features:

   - Shows real-time P&L from Polymarket Data API
   - Displays entry price, current price, unrealized profit/loss
   - Works perfectly in `/portfolio`

   - Fetches live position data (shares, token_id)
   - Places sell order on Polymarket
   - Updates database with realized P&L
   - **Confirmed working** (closed position ID 1 successfully)

3. **Balance Display**
   - Shows both USDC and USDC.e balances
   - Correctly sums both token types
   - Real-time on-chain balance checking
   - **Current balance: $49.96**

4. **Interactive Trading Interface**

   - Projected payout calculation
   - Validation against available balance

5. **Allowance Management**

   - Checks existing allowances before approving
   - All approvals confirmed on-chain

## ‚ùå Current Issue

### Problem: Second Trade Failing
**Symptom:** Getting "not enough balance / allowance" error on new trades

**What We Know:**
- First trade SUCCEEDED (Trump MLB: bought @ 99¬¢, sold @ 1¬¢)
- Position close SUCCEEDED
- Balance available: $49.96 USDC.e
- Allowances confirmed on-chain multiple times:
  - USDC.e approved for CTF Exchange ‚úÖ
  - USDC approved for CTF Exchange ‚úÖ
  - CTF tokens approved for CTF Exchange ‚úÖ

**Debug Output Shows:**
```
[DEBUG] Current USDC.e allowance: [should show large number]
[DEBUG] Best ask found: 0.999
[DEBUG] Calculated: stake=$1.00, price=$0.9900, size=1.0202 shares
ERROR: not enough balance / allowance
```

## ü§î Theories

### Theory 1: Wrong Exchange Contract
- We're approving `0x4bFb41d5B3570DeFd03C39a9A4D8dE6Bd8B8982E`
- Maybe there's a different contract for certain markets?
- Negative risk markets use `NegRiskAdapter`?

### Theory 2: Direct EOA Limitations
- Maybe Direct EOA mode has quota limits?
- Or requires re-approval after each trade?
- Or only works for certain market types?

### Theory 3: Polymarket API Caching
- Approvals are on-chain but API hasn't indexed them
- First trade worked because system was fresh
- Now API is in a bad state

## üéØ Next Steps to Resolve

### Option A: Test on Polymarket.com (Recommended)
1. Go to polymarket.com (with VPN)
2. Connect MetaMask with your wallet
3. Try placing a $1 trade
4. Note what happens:
   - Does it work immediately?
   - Does it ask for any approvals?
   - What error do you get?

This will definitively tell us if it's:
- Account setup issue
- Or code/API issue

### Option B: Try Proxy Mode
Since all documentation examples use proxy mode:
1. Transfer USDC.e back to proxy (`0x72dB4a2F...`)
2. Update config:
   ```yaml
   signature_type: 2
   polymarket_proxy_address: "0x72dB4a2F113c73Bbf270e92D7ece446710B658b9"
   ```
3. Try trading

### Option C: Check Contract Addresses
Verify we're using correct contracts:
- CTF Exchange: `0x4bFb41d5B3570DeFd03C39a9A4D8dE6Bd8B8982E`
- CTF Contract: `0x4D97DCd97eC945f40cF65F87097ACe5EA0476045`
- USDC.e: `0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174`
