# Database Reset & Mode Separation Complete

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Wiped Clean
- Removed old trades from before real/paper trading implementation
- Fresh start with new `trade_mode` column

### 2. Mode-Based Filtering Implemented
All portfolio functions now filter by trading mode:

**Functions Updated:**
- `metrics()` - Shows stats for current mode only
- `list_active()` - Shows active positions for current mode
- `list_history()` - Shows history for current mode

### 3. Improved Balance Display
Enhanced error handling and visibility for USDC balance:

```
On-Chain Balances:
  USDC: $50.00
```

If balance fails to load, you'll see detailed error messages.

## 🔄 How Mode Separation Works

### Paper Mode
```yaml
trading:
  mode: paper
```
- Shows only paper trades
- Uses tracked cash balance ($10,000 starting)
- No on-chain balance display

### Real Mode
```yaml
trading:
  mode: real
```
- Shows only real trades
- Displays actual USDC balance from Polygon
- Executes real transactions

## 📊 Portfolio Display

When you run `/portfolio`, you'll now see:

```
REAL MODE
Showing real trades only

[Metrics for real trades only]

On-Chain Balances:
  USDC: $50.00

[Active real positions]
[Recent real trades]

Tracked Cash Available: $10,000.00  # Paper tracking (separate)
Cash In Play: $0.00
```

## 🔍 Balance Debugging

If USDC balance shows $0.00 or error:

1. **Check Polygonscan**: https://polygonscan.com/address/0xE47127d12d030035a1898f6FF7944E71ed923739
2. **Verify Network**: Must be Polygon (not Ethereum)
3. **Check Token**: USDC contract `0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359`
4. **Private Key**: Must be in `.env` as `POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY`

The portfolio will show raw balance data if debugging is needed.

## 🧪 Testing

Try these commands:

```bash
polly

# Check balance (should show $50 USDC)
polly> /portfolio

# Switch to paper mode to test separation
# Edit ~/.polly/config.yml, change mode: paper
polly> /portfolio  # Should show no trades, paper balance

# Switch back to real mode
# Edit ~/.polly/config.yml, change mode: real
polly> /portfolio  # Should show real trades, USDC balance
```

## 📝 Key Changes Made

**Files Modified:**
- `polly/storage/trades.py` - Added `filter_mode` parameter to metrics, list_active, list_history
- `polly/commands/portfolio.py` - Pass current mode as filter, improved balance error handling
- Database: Wiped clean, ready for fresh trades

**Result:**
- ✅ Complete separation between paper and real trades
- ✅ Mode-specific portfolio views
- ✅ Better USDC balance visibility
- ✅ Detailed error messages for debugging

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Run `/portfolio` to see your $50 USDC balance
2. Browse markets: `/polls 7`
3. Try a small test trade: `/trade 1 Yes 10`
4. Or use research flow: `/research 1`

Your portfolio will now correctly track paper and real trades separately!
